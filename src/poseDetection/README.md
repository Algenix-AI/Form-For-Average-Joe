Add redux for login state and tensorflow
Factory methods for values objects
Link button to set state

Migrate https://yarnpkg.com/package/parcel-bundler or webpack   

Machine learning algorithms vs in-built algorithms  - Need to learn ML first
Face recognition
Object/Background detection
Detect equipment (barbell and bench)
Implement algorithm to check form, and suggest corrections
Count the number of repetitions for you, based on proper form
Track exercise type, number of repetitions, number of sets, and weight lifted. Estimate calories burnt.

- Features to be completed by the mid of July:
- Provide recommendations for future workouts
Gamification system
Reward users with points for each successful set of exercise
Different point milestone will earn user a new level/status
Friends
Challenge friends, keep track of their workouts
Leaderboard
Difficulty tiers
Suggest corrections to user via audio

When to identify the start of set - timer countdown - auto-detection later - Timer feature / to failure feature
Count reps either with button or at start

Output overlay on video - do the simpler assessment mode - then tutorial/continuous mode

use redux for state

Extras
Variations - female/easy pushup, sumo deadlift, half-squat
angled - 3D with Z coordinate - this applies to calibration
- pick one side
- ask user to adjust to perpendicular position

Optimise imports

1. Advanced version of a leaderboard - run it on a schedule to aggregate all users' performance - there is potential to write this as a microservice and Dockerise it
2. Analytics: track your progress over time, check how your progression compares to other (anonymised) users
3. ML: do some basic ML for some of the more complicated exercises, but potentially time-consuming
4. Add a service for coaches - so users can get some personalised coaching services, coaches can review the video and our algo's recommendations
5. Typescript rather than JavaScript for the frontend, Golang/NodeJS for backend services
